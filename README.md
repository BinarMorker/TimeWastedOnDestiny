Time Wasted on Destiny
======================
A project that started simple and expanded into a full-fetched utility website and API for developers. If you feel like contributing to this project, feel free to do so by emailing me first at [my email address](mailto://binarmorker@gmail.com). This repository is only the project's source code, and is not the actual website. The website can be found at [this url](http://wastedondestiny.com).

This website costs me a bunch to host, so please consider [donating](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5YLYAY74SZP6W).

## Installation
### Requirements
1. PHP 5.3 or later
2. MySQL (only for the leaderboard)
3. A valid Bungie API key

### Getting started
1. Download the source and put it where PHP can run it.
2. Go to [Bungie API Registration Portal](https://www.bungie.net/en/user/api) and request a key by entering your email.
3. Add your key (and your database information) to the file `config.json`.

## Usage
### Website
Just go to `http://wastedondestiny.com` to lookup a Destiny account.

The website will query our internal API to show the account info from Bungie's servers.

### API
It is possible to access the API yourself and use it without going through the website.
Be aware though that it may generate a lot of traffic if you use it intensively, so be cautious. 
To reduce the risks of bandwidth overload, data generated by the API is cached for 1 hour.

For usage instructions, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/BinarMorker/TimeWastedOnDestiny/wiki) or go to `http://wastedondestiny.com/api`
