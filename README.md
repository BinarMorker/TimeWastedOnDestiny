Time Wasted on Destiny
======================
A project that started simple and expanded into a full-fetched utility website and API for developers. If you feel like contributing to this project, feel free to do so by emailing me first at [my email address](mailto://binarmorker@gmail.com). This repository is only the project's source code, and is not the actual website. The website can be found at [this url](http://wastedondestiny.com).

This website costs me a bunch to host, so please consider [donating](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5YLYAY74SZP6W)

## Usage
Just go to `http://wastedondestiny.com` to lookup a Destiny account.

The website will access our internal API to query the account info from Bungie's servers.

It is possible to access the API yourself and use it without going through the website.
Be aware though that it may generate a lot of traffic if you use it intensively, so be cautious. 
To reduce the risks of bandwidth overload, data generated by the API is cached for 1 hour.
