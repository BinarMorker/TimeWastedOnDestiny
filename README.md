Time Wasted on Destiny
======================
A project that started simple and expanded into a full-fetched utility website and API for developers. If you feel like contributing to this project, feel free to do so by emailing me first at [my email address](mailto://binarmorker@gmail.com). This repository is only the project's source code, and is not the actual website. The website can be found at [this url](http://wastedondestiny.com).

## Usage
The website work this way:
1. The main page, index.php, is accessed through a browser.
2. The script main.js is called when a username and a console have been submitted.
3. The script request.php returns an array of values for usage by main.js.
4. The javascript shows a selection of values into the main page, index.php.

It is possible to access request.php externally and use it without going through index.php.
Be aware though that it may generate a lot of traffic if you use it intensively, so be cautious. 
To reduce the risks of bandwidth overload, data generated by request.php is cached for 1 hour.

For usage instructions for the API, refer to the file help.txt or launch the script /request.php?help
